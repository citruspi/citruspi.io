<p>Another student walked up to me earlier today, asking for my help in getting
    some files off a thumb drive and onto an Ubuntu virtual machine running on
    Windows.</p>

<p>We tried to</p>

<ul>
    <li>connect the thumb drive to the VM</li>
    <li>send the files via email</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither worked - the VM refused to connect to the drive and Firefox in the
    VM refused to render Gmail properly.</p>

<p>My solution?</p>

<p>I plugged his drive into my Macbook, <code>cd</code>'ed to <code>
    /Volumes/UNTITLED</code> and ran</p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I then opened <code>IP:8000</code> on his computer and downloaded the files
    via his web browser.</p>

<p>You can reduce the amount of typing required by creating an alias:</p>

{% highlight 'bash' %}
$ alias server="python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
$ server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Quickly running an HTTP server is faster than pulling out
    a flash drive, transferring the files onto it, giving it to another person,
    and having them copy it to their computer.</p>
